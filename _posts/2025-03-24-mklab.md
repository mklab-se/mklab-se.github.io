Out of my 30+ years in the IT industry, I’ve spent the last 17 years at Microsoft, working with brilliant colleagues and some of the world’s largest companies. I had the privilege of witnessing the birth of Microsoft Azure, as part of the Microsoft Azure Incubation Team, back when we had to convince customers that cloud computing was the future. Over the years, I’ve seen technologies emerge—and some disappear just as quickly. More recently, I’ve been at the forefront of the AI revolution, witnessing firsthand how it’s transforming industries. It’s been an incredible journey—drinking from the fire hose, as they say. And now, with a push from fate, I’m stepping away from the company I’ve loved working for—after nearly a third of my life—to start my own venture.

> I'm proud to announce the launch of MKLab

I’m proud to announce the launch of MKLab, my own consulting company, where I’ll bring my expertise and experience to a new set of clients and projects. My focus areas will include:

- Leadership & Coaching
- Technical Program & Agile Project Management
- Software Engineering & IT Architecture

Beyond technical expertise, I take pride in blending these skills with strong social and leadership abilities. I’m excited to collaborate on meaningful and successful projects in the years ahead!

For those who know me, you’re also aware of my creative side. I won’t rule out taking on assignments in media and photography, so if you’re in need of a photographer, let’s talk!

If you're looking for expertise with a personal touch, let’s connect! Get in touch to explore how I can help your business succeed. Looking forward to this new adventure and to working with amazing clients along the way!
