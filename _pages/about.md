## Who We Are

In March 2025, Martin Kristofer Liljeblad founded the consulting firm MKLab after spending more than 30 years in the IT industry. The last 17 of those years were spent at Microsoft, where he both used and played a role in the emergence of groundbreaking technologies such as Cloud Computing and AI. Technologies come and go, but the importance of understanding "why we do something" has always been Kristofer’s guiding principle. After all, if you don’t know **why**, how can you be sure you're doing the right thing?
  
Another fundamental belief at MKLab is that technology ultimately serves people. This is something that can be easy to forget in today’s AI-driven world. Strong leadership isn’t just about technical expertise, it requires clear communication, collaboration, and the ability to empower others. These are qualities often overlooked in IT but remain at the heart of how MKLab operates. Working as a team and enabling people to succeed is not an afterthought, it’s how we do business.
