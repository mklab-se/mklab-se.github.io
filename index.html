        <h2>About me and MKLab</h2>
        <p class="text-muted">At MKLab I bring three decades of experience in technology, including 17 years at Microsoft, but also something more personal: a genuine love for staying on the forefront of tech. For me, keeping up with new tools, methods, and trends isn’t a burden, it’s fun. It’s what keeps me curious and motivated, and it’s the spark I bring to every engagement.</p>
        
        <p class="text-muted">I’ve always loved to lead and coach, but in a way that makes people want to follow, not because they’re told to, but because they feel it’s right. I strive to be clear, supportive, and pedagogic, and few things are more rewarding than seeing the lightbulb switch on for someone else. I believe leadership is about building trust and energy, not just managing tasks.</p>

        <p class="text-muted">I also keep close to the work. I enjoy digging into architecture, improving platforms, and working side by side with engineers. At the same time, I never forget that technology is about people. We’re humans first, and that human touch is often what makes the difference between a good solution and a great one.</p>

        <p class="text-muted">For me, teamwork is at the core. Sure, I could sometimes get something done faster alone, but the real value comes from moving forward together, learning as a group, and building lasting capabilities. That’s what creates momentum for companies and customers alike.</p>

        <p class="text-muted">Whether you need interim leadership, a seasoned program lead, or a partner to modernize your platform, MKLab helps you move from vision to shipped value, with both technical depth and a people-first approach.</p>
